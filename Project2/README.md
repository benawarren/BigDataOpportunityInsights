In this empirical project, you will use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal
effect of class size on test scores. To answer some of the questions, you will need to refer to the
following papers:

1. [Chetty, Raj, John N. Friedman, Nathaniel Hilger, Emmanuel Saez, Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, and
Danny Yagan. 2011. “How Does Your Kindergarten Classroom Affect Your Earnings? Evidence from
Project STAR,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 126(4): 1593–1660.](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/star_paper.pdf)

2. [Angrist, Joshua D., and Victor Lavy. 1999. “Using Maimonides’ Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size
on Scholastic Achievement,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 114(2): 533–575.](https://economics.mit.edu/files/8273)

The Stata data file grade5.dta consists of test scores in fifth grade classes at public elementary
schools in Israel. These data were originally used in Angrist and Lavy (1999).
