## Project 3 Extended Description (Full [Here](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/project3.pdf))

In this empirical project, you will analyze experimental data from the ongoing Creating Moves to
Opportunity Experiment (CMTO).

In particular, you will analyze data from pilot studies
conducted in partnership with the King County Public Housing Authority (KCHA) and the Seattle
Public Housing Authority (SHA).

Each Public Housing Authority (KCHA and SHA) handled recruitment into the experiment and
randomization separately, although they followed the same procedure. Families with at least one
child below age 15 who submitted applications for Section 8 housing vouchers were asked if they
would like to participate in the experiment. Families who said yes were then randomly assigned
to two groups: 
 - a control group that received the standard services for families with a Section 8
voucher and 
 - an experimental treatment group that was offered an additional suite of services
oriented to help families move to high-opportunity areas. These additional services included
information about opportunity areas, assistance in identifying available units and in getting in
contact with landlords, and some financial assistance for moving expenses. 

Importantly, treatment
group families were not required to use these services and were not required to move to higher
opportunity places if they did not want to do so. For more information about the study, see the
websites for Opportunity Insights, Creating Moves to Opportunity, and the Poverty Action
Laboratory.


Your analysis of these data is at the cutting edge of affordable housing policy. CMTO is currently
in the pilot phase in Seattle and King County, but conversations are now underway to expand it to
many other cities across the U.S., shown in the map below.
