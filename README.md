# Big Data - Opportunity Insights
The Harvard economist Raj Chetty and his team at Opportunity Insights have done excellent work investigating the trends behind economic mobility in the US over the last half-century. One of the ways they've made this work available to the public is through their course, Using Big Data to Solve Economic and Social Problems, first offered at Harvard in Spring 2019 and available ([here](https://opportunityinsights.org/course/)) on their website now.

In this repository, I will post my work on the empirical projects for that course, which interest me because of their focus on understanding the application of quantitative, empirical methods to difficult social science questions. Descriptions of each of the projects are below:

1. Stories from the Atlas: Describing Data using Maps, Regressions, and Correlations
  - In this first empirical project, you will use the Opportunity Atlas mapping tool and the underlying
data to describe equality of opportunity in your hometown and across the United States. (If you
grew up outside the United States, you may select a community in which you have spent some
time, such as Boston, MA.)
2. Do Smaller Classes Improve Test Scores? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design
  - In this empirical project, you will use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal
effect of class size on test scores.
3. The Creating Moves to Opportunity (CMTO) Experiment
  - In this empirical project, you will analyze experimental data from the ongoing Creating Moves to
Opportunity Experiment (CMTO). In particular, you will analyze data from pilot studies
conducted in partnership with the King County Public Housing Authority (KCHA) and the Seattle
Public Housing Authority (SHA). 
4. Using Google DataCommons to Predict Social Mobility
  - In this Empirical Project, you will use variables from Google DataCommons to predict
intergenerational mobility using machine learning methods. The measure of intergenerational
mobility that we will focus on is the mean rank of a child whose parents were at the 25th percentile
of the national income distribution in each county (kfr_pooled_p25). Your goal is to
construct the best predictions of this outcome using other variables, an important step in creating
forecasts of upward mobility that could be used for future generations before data on their
outcomes become available.
