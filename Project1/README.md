# Project1 Extended Description (full found [here](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/project1-1.pdf))

The Opportunity Atlas was publicly released on October 1, 2018, and an accompanying article
appeared on the front page of the New York Times. The Opportunity Atlas is a freely available
interactive mapping tool that traces the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back
to the neighborhoods in which children grew up.

Policymakers, journalists, and the public have begun to explore the Opportunity Atlas, casting
new light on the geography of upward mobility in communities across the country. As an example,
see Jasmine Garsdâ€™s recent analysis for the New York City neighborhood of Brownsville in
Brooklyn.

In this first empirical project, you will use the Opportunity Atlas mapping tool and the underlying
data to describe equality of opportunity in your hometown and across the United States. (If you
grew up outside the United States, you may select a community in which you have spent some
time, such as Boston, MA.)

The end product will be a 4-6 page narrative (or story) in which you describe what you have learned
from the Atlas. The next page lists specific analyses and questions that your narrative must
address. It should be double spaced with references, graphs, and maps.

This project focuses on the following methods for descriptive data analysis. (The later empirical
projects you will do in this class will be focused on causal inference and prediction).

1. Data visualization. Maps are a powerful way to present descriptive statistics for data with
a geographic component. You will use maps to display upward mobility statistics for the
Census tracts in your hometown.
2. Regression and correlation analysis. You will use linear regressions and correlation
coefficients to quantify the statistical relationship between upward mobility and potential
explanatory variables.
